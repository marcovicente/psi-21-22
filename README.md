## Product Vision
* What is the product
 “The minimum plan necessary to start a Scrum project consists of a vision and a Product Backlog. The vision describes why the project is being undertaken and what the desired end state is.” (Schwaber 2004, p. 68)

* Who is the target customer? Who is going to buy/use the product? 
* Which customer needs will the product address?  
* Which product attributes are critical to satisfy the needs selected, and therefore for the success of the product?  
* What are the benefits and key features

### Product Vision Elevator Statement *
* FOR (target customer)
* WHO (statement of the need)
* THE ((product name) is a (product category))
* THAT (key product benefit, reason to buy/use)
* UNLIKE (competitive alternatives)
* OUR PRODUCT (final statement of differentiation)
 
`* Geoffrey Moore: Crossing the Chasm`

#### A sample product vision statement:

“For a mid-sized company’s marketing and sales departments who need basic CRM functionality, the CRM-Innovator is a Web-based service that provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points. Unlike other services or package software products, our product provides very capable services at a moderate cost.”
